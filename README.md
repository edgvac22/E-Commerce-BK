# E-Commerce in PHP

Hello, I'm Edgardo Vaca. This would ve very easy.

- First import the database (all is in ecommerce.sql), remember this is MySql
- Copy all the files in to another file, you can put anyone name. In to the xampp/htdocs
- Run your apache and mysql into your server.
- Then, just need to enter to localhost/NameOfYourFile/login.html (and you would be in the login)

You can enter with:
- email: testuser@gmail.com
- password: testuser

Or you can create your account.
